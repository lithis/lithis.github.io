<TD>What are your thoughts on the number seven:</TD>
<TD WIDTH=7></TD>
<TD>Just as the Smurfs use the word "smurf"<BR>
in every sentence, I think it would be<BR>
possible for someone addicted to the number<BR>
seven to replace many adjectives, adverbs,<BR>
verbs, nouns, and expletives with the<BR>
said number.<BR>
<BR>
For example: "What the hell do you think<BR>
you're doing with my sister?" might be<BR>
translated as "What the seven do you seven<BR>
you're sevening with my seven?"  Admittedly,<BR>
it sounds odd; however, the possibilities<BR>
of integrating the popular use of the<BR>
number sever in everyday vocabulary are<BR>
endless.</TD>
