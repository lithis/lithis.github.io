It started the journey on May 3 in California and ended on July 6 in New York. Pilots and creators Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg took turns manning the single-seat flyer, which is powered by about 12,000 silicon solar cells and has a wingspan of a jumbo jet. The next step is a trip around the world in 2015.%0A <a href=" http://tammyconnorid.com/blog/ ">20mg paxil too much</a>  %C3%A2%C2%80%C2%9CMaybe our place in this market, this city, is we take those things to heart,%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%9D manager John Farrell said. %C3%A2%C2%80%C2%9CIn some ways this game and what we do here at Fenway is a vehicle to acknowledge others.%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%9D%0A </TD>
