<TD>What are your thoughts on the number seven:</TD>
<TD WIDTH=7></TD>
<TD>7!=5040<BR>
when converted to hex, 7!=13B0<BR>
which can be interpreted as<BR>
"13 bo" in the form of a hex<BR>
by all the supersticious people out there.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
8 isn't all that bad either:<BR>
<BR>
8 sideways is infinity<BR>
7 sideways is, um...  ...something<BR>
<BR>
The 8th character on a standard kerboard is F7<BR>
F7 converted to a decimal number is 247<BR>
rightmost digit=7<BR>
also, 2+4+7=13
