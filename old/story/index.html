      <P>At 15 years old, Kristofer Nelson walked into Saturn Systems and asked 
      what the folks there were doing.
      <P>The computer programmers at the Morgan Park consulting firm talked 
      about what they were working on, and Nelson seemed interested. He said he, 
      too, was a programmer.
      <P>They shrugged, said they might have something for him to do and handed 
      him a broom. Over the next few days, Nelson swept the office, dutifully 
      cleaned and took out the garbage. Then he mustered the courage to remind 
      them why he was there: to write software.
      <P>Some were skeptical; some even laughed. But they decided to give him a 
      shot. What they saw amazed them.
      <P>With a flurry of keystrokes, Nelson showed he knew plenty about 
      computers and writing software. That was three years ago, and he hasn't 
      touched a broom since.
      <P>Now 18 and a Wrenshall High School graduate, Nelson is a full-time 
      programmer with Saturn Systems and appears destined for a career in 
      computers.
      <P>And while many others his age are spending their summer flipping 
      burgers, mowing lawns or folding sweat- ers at the mall, Nelson earns a 
      check clacking away on a keyboard.
      <P>``They think I'm really lucky,'' Nelson said of his friends' 
      impressions of his work. ``Some of them say, `Wow, that's good.' ''
      <P>
      <P><STRONG>Humble, low-tech beginnings</STRONG>
      <P>
      <P>Nelson cut his computer programming teeth on an old computer he found 
      in his parent's basement. It was a TRS-80 made by Radio Shack -- among the 
      first mass-produced personal computers.
      <P>Reliable but labor-intensive, the TRS-80 needed to be told how to do 
      everything. Nelson, then a sixth-grader, read the owner's manual and 
      managed to write a few simple game programs.
      <P>Computer programming is, at its most basic, using a specific language 
      (typically commands involving words, letters and symbols) to get a 
      computer to perform a specific task.
      <P>By the time Nelson was in eighth grade, his family purchased a 486K 
      computer -- significantly faster, more powerful and more sophisticated 
      than the TRS-80.
      <P>``It was a pretty fast machine,'' Nelson recalled. ``At first I didn't 
      use it very much.''
      <P>But Nelson soon began programming that computer into doing digital 
      gymnastics. He purchased a new, more powerful language and began creating 
      ``utilities'' for himself and optimized the memory in the computer.
      <P>How did he know what he was doing?
      <P>``I was reading books and trying stuff,'' he said.
      <P>He said he realized almost immediately that he enjoyed that kind of 
      work. He also realized he was good at it.
      <P>
      <P><STRONG>Others take note</STRONG>
      <P>
      <P>``He's always been interested in computers,'' said Bill Lagarde, 
      Nelson's math teacher and the computer coordinator for Wrenshall High 
      School. ``You get him focused on the right thing and he's really good.''
      <P>Lagarde remembers what Nelson did with the school's Power Macintosh 
      6100 and some 3-D imaging software.
      <P>``He did some cool animation things with that,'' Lagarde said. ``He was 
      pro-PCs and I was pro-Macs. I recall he did something depicting a PC 
      destroying a Mac thing. That was pretty cool.''
      <P>Lagarde said Nelson could go far.
      <P>``If he's doing what he wants to do, he's probably as good as 
      anybody,'' he said. ``I think he's had a company name picked out for about 
      the last seven years now.''
      <P>His father, Rod Nelson, a project coordinator with the City of Duluth's 
      engineering division, said he was soon learning from his own son.
      <P>Despite his own computer prowess, the elder Nelson was having a hard 
      time keeping up with the younger one.
      <P>``One minute I was kind of showing him about the computer, and the next 
      minute he was teaching me,'' Rod Nelson said.
      <P>Marilyn Schroeder, an information technician in the engineering 
      department where Kristofer helped write a database program, said she 
      couldn't believe the work he was doing.
      <P>``I was just in awe when I watched him work,'' Schroeder said. ``He's 
      just an incredibly bright kid. I just go, `Whoa!' when I look at some of 
      the things he set up.''
      <P>
      <P><STRONG>Impressive in the real world</STRONG>
      <P>
      <P>Just a few months ago Nelson designed computer forms and reports for a 
      health-systems database at Duluth's ScanHealth.
      <P>Desiree Peterson, director of corporate information for ScanHealth, a 
      software development firm for home health-care companies, says Nelson has 
      a natural flair for that kind of work.
      <P>``He's a real bright kid and has a real good handle on databases,'' 
      Peterson said. ``He's above average. But he needs to be more of a kid, I 
      think. But that's just the mother in me.''
      <P>Despite Nelson's age, Peterson and others at ScanHealth never 
      questioned his ability.
      <P>``When we contracted with Saturn Systems and heard about Kris, I said, 
      `Hey, I got no problem with an 18-year-old.' ''
      <P>Mark Chmielewski, a programmer/analyst with Saturn Systems, said Nelson 
      is a ``code pig,'' a term reserved for those who can crank out line after 
      line of computer code while sitting at a terminal for hours at a time.
      <P>``He gets the job done,'' said Chmielewski. ``He knows as much about 
      computers as the rest of us.''
      <P>Chmielewski also said on a scale of 1 to 10, Nelson's programming 
      skills are a 9.
      <P>``His hobby has become his career,'' Chmielewski said. ``Where the rest 
      of us might rather be out fishing or golfing, he'd rather be writing 
      code.''
      <P>Nelson is versed in Basic, C and C++, Perl and HTML computer languages 
      and has dabbled in several other languages.
      <P>
      <P><STRONG>Job prospects abound</STRONG>
      <P>
      <P>Despite his lack of formal training, Nelson's abilities would easily 
      land him a job at many software firms.
      <P>For now, he plans to continue working at Saturn Systems and attend Lake 
      Superior College in the fall, where he already has amassed several college 
      credits while he was a high school student.
      <P>Within two years he hopes to transfer to the University of 
      Minnesota-Duluth and study computer science.
      <P>Beyond that, he's not sure where he'll go. But the planned Duluth 
      Technology Village and its potential tenants are encouraging.
      <P>It might allow him to stay in town and earn the kind of money he might 
      expect on the West Coast or in other high-technology hotbeds.
