<p>
	i took these pictures when i went to california. some of the pictures
	were cool, so here're the best ones. i had camera problems and the film
	was exposed to light, unfortunately.
</p>

<p>
	<img src="images/california/stopsign.jpg" width=512 height=343 alt="a stop sign"><br>
	this is a californian stop sign. it looks similar to most minnesotan
	stop signs. however, californians seem to be a bit lax on obeying them.
</p>

<p>
	<img src="images/california/powerlines.jpg" width=512 height=343 alt="power lines"><br>
	these are californian power lines in the middle of nowhere. i can't
	imagine why the middle of nowhere would need so many power lines, but
	there seem to be a lot of them.
</p>

<p>
	<img src="images/california/hills.jpg" width=512 height=343 alt="hills"><br>
	here are some beautiful californian hills. i also got a few of the
	aformentioned power lines in the picture.
</p>

<p>
	<img src="images/california/yellowlines.jpg" width=512 height=231 alt="yellow lines"><br>
	mmm... i love the yellow lines down the middle of the road.
</p>

<p>
	<img src="images/california/shrubs.jpg" width=512 height=343 alt="shrubs"><br>
	we were driving kinda fast when i took this picture. i think this was
	taken on the same road as the yellow lines above.
</p>

<p>
	<img src="images/california/ocean.jpg" width=512 height=178 alt="the ocean"><br>
	this is a very cool panorama of the ocean. the colors didn't
	scan very well, though.

	there's a better version on the remastered page.
