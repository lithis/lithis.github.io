<!--p>
	my washington trip produced many pictures, some of which may be
	seen in their <a href="images/washington/">raw scan</a> form. more
	will be uploaded soon, so check the raw scans again if you&rsquo;re
	incredibly determined to see my pictures. the resizing process for
	both the washington pictures and the below pictures is still in
	process, but should be finished soon.
</p-->

<!--
	and as an added bonus, opera (http://opera.com) can resize the raw
	scans to make them easier to view... update: internet explorer now
	resizes images. the score is opera 1, ie 1. but opera gives you
	more control over image size. opera 2, ie 1.
-->

<!--p>
	i&rsquo;m in the process of cleaning up more pictures. you can look
	at the <a href="images/new_new/">raw scans</a> until i get them
	resized and cleaned up.
